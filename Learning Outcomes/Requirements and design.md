# Requirements and design
***
*You analyze (non-functional) requirements, elaborate (architectural) designs and validate them using multiple types of test techniques.*

## Gathering Stakeholder Feedback and Creating User Stories and Tasks
***
In order to achieve the learning outcome requirements and design, we followed a systematic approach that involved active engagement with stakeholders throughout the entire process. We recognized the importance of gathering feedback from stakeholders to inform our decisions and ensure the application met their needs effectively.

## Structure Diagram
Displayed below is the current structure of the application. The image illustrates the communication flow between the front-end and all the services within the application.

To begin, we utilized the feedback from stakeholders to create user stories and tasks. These user stories helped us understand the specific goals and requirements of the application from the perspective of different user roles. By breaking down the functionalities into smaller, manageable tasks, we were able to align our design and development efforts more efficiently.

## Design during front-end developement
***
During the front-end development phase, we embraced a collaborative approach that involved active engagement with stakeholders. In addition to gathering feedback, we also encouraged stakeholders to provide examples that illustrated their preferences and requirements.

To initiate the design process, we conducted brainstorming sessions where we generated various ideas. These ideas were translated into visual representations by extensively utilizing whiteboards. Through sketches and diagrams, we visualized the initial design concepts and shared them with stakeholders. We actively sought their feedback and incorporated their suggestions into the design iterations.

Building upon the initial designs, we moved forward with creating wireframes. These wireframes served as detailed representations of the application's layout and functionality. To ensure alignment with stakeholder expectations, we incorporated the feedback received, including the specific examples they provided. For instance, stakeholders referenced the website Zoho Analytics as an example of the kind of design they found appealing and functional. We examined their work, made screenshots, and added notes to incorporate the desired elements into our own design.

By incorporating stakeholders' real-life scenarios, use cases, and specific examples like Zoho Analytics, we were able to create a design that not only met their needs and requirements but also reflected their preferences.
