*You recognize and take into account cultural differences between project stakeholders and ethical aspects in software development.*

## Cultural differences

In our workflow and programming, we had to make several adjustments due to cultural differences within our group. The most significant difference was that one of our team members was originally from Latvia, not the Netherlands. This meant that we frequently had to switch to English when communicating and writing, as it was a common language for all of us. Fortunately, we were all well-versed in English, and we could rely on each other for assistance when communication became challenging.

Another notable difference we observed was the contrasting work styles between the Dutch members of our group (Bram, Stijn, Sylvester, Joey, and Laurens) and Artjoms, our team member from Latvia. The Dutch individuals tended to have a more laid-back approach, while Artjoms consistently displayed a strong work ethic and often went above and beyond what was necessary. This difference in work style could be attributed to Artjoms' previous experience with course-based learning, which tends to be more structured and lesson-based. In contrast, the Dutch guys were accustomed to demand-based learning, which allows for more flexibility and leniency.

Due to the cultural differences within our team, we also experienced some advantages. One notable advantage was that the need to primarily communicate in English required us to spend more time thinking about what we wanted to say or write. This extra deliberation often led us to come up with better alternatives or ideas for the project. The process of carefully considering our language choices and expressing ourselves in a non-native language forced us to be more intentional and creative in our approach. This linguistic diversity became a catalyst for innovative thinking and problem-solving, enhancing the overall quality of our work.

## Code Ethics

In our project aimed at data analysts and salespersons in large wholesale stores, we prioritize code ethics and adhere to the principles of Professional Competence set forth by the ACM [(Association for Computing Machinery)](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics). Our product facilitates the efficient viewing of store data, such as the availability of products, without intending to replace any employees' jobs. Our focus is on streamlining the process of gathering data within a specific timeframe, making it easier and more efficient for users. Throughout our development, we conducted extensive research on various technologies, including API gateways, microservices, and GraphQL, among other things. By incorporating these technologies, we ensure that our project aligns with industry standards and leverages the most effective tools available, all while upholding the code ethics and professional competence expected in the field.
