*You use software tooling and methodology that continuously monitors and improve the software quality during software development.*

## What is agile?
***

Agile is an iterative and incremental approach to project management and software development. It stands out for its emphasis on flexibility, collaboration, and adaptability. 
By breaking projects into smaller units called sprints or iterations, teams work together to deliver the product.
Agile methodologies foster close collaboration, transparent communication, and frequent meetings to track progress and address any challenges that arise. Notably, 
Agile embraces change and adjusts plans based on feedback and evolving requirements, allowing for a fluid and responsive development process.

## Scrum
***
In our group project, we implemented the Scrum framework. We embraced the iterative nature of Scrum and divided our work into sprints lasting three weeks each. These time-boxed sprints allowed us to focus on specific goals and deliverables, ensuring a steady and measurable progress. At the end of each sprint, we held a sprint review and retrospective using the 4 L's method. This involved reflecting on what we Learned, what went well (Liked), what could be improved (Lacked), and what actions we would take moving forward (Longed for). Through this structured approach, we were able to regularly assess our progress, identify areas for improvement.

## Jira
***
In our project, we utilized Jira as a powerful tool to aid us in managing our sprints and backlog effectively. Initially, we organized our sprints by creating large user stories and linking relevant tasks to them. However, after receiving valuable feedback from Paul, our teacher, we decided to revamp our Jira board. We implemented a different style by breaking down our user stories into smaller, more manageable chunks, with subtasks linked to each of them. This approach not only improved the granularity of our project tasks but also made it easier for us to estimate and assign story points.

In addition to our Jira setup for managing sprints and backlog, we incorporated a few extra columns to further enhance our project workflow. One of these columns was dedicated to stories that required alterations, providing a visual indication for tasks that needed adjustments or revisions. Although we ultimately didn't utilize this column extensively, its inclusion demonstrated our commitment to adaptability and flexibility in our project management approach.

Furthermore, we implemented two review columns in Jira to ensure the quality and accuracy of our deliverables. The first column, "Ready for Review," served as a checkpoint for tasks that were deemed complete and ready to be reviewed by other team members or stakeholders. The second column, "In Review," indicated that the tasks were currently being assessed for correctness, functionality, and adherence to project requirements. These review columns enabled us to maintain a systematic and thorough validation process, ensuring that the work we produced met the necessary standards and specifications.
