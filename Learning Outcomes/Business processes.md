## Requirements & Design
***
To begin our web application project for World of Content, we engaged with the stakeholders and gathered their feedback and input. Based on this information, we created user stories and tasks that outlined the functionalities and features required for the application. We also developed multiple designs to visualize and iterate on the project's visual aspects. The detailed designs can be found [here](https://github.com/Null-Not-Found/DashBuddy-Documentation/blob/main/Learning%20Outcomes/Requirements%20and%20design.md).

## Agile Method
***
For efficient project management and collaboration, we adopted the Agile method, specifically utilizing the Scrum framework. This allowed us to break down the project into manageable sprints, prioritize tasks, and regularly communicate and adjust our approach based on feedback and changing requirements. We followed an Agile approach that ensured flexibility and responsiveness throughout the development process. Further insights into our use of Agile can be found [here](https://github.com/Null-Not-Found/DashBuddy-Documentation/blob/main/Learning%20Outcomes/Agile%20Method.md).


## Documentation
***
Documentation played a crucial role in ensuring clarity and transparency throughout the project. We leveraged GitHub as our central repository and documented our progress extensively. The documentation included setup instructions, which made it easier for team members and stakeholders to understand the project structure and requirements. Additionally, we documented the design choices made for both the front-end and back-end, providing insights into the rationale behind our implementation decisions.

## Testing
***
To ensure the quality and reliability of our web application, we implemented a robust testing strategy. We developed tests for our back-end API, focusing on testing the microservices and employing intergration testing techniques. This allowed us to validate the functionality of the application's core components. Additionally, we implemented automated testing through GitHub Actions, enabling continuous integration (CI) and ensuring that any issues were caught early in the development cycle. This CI setup protected the project's codebase and maintained its stability.
